# Telecom Customer Complaints Analysis
This project aims to analyze customer reviews in the telecom industry and identify keywords that are associated with customer dissatisfaction. The analysis is done using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform EDA analysis and text preprocessing using spaCy, nltk and visualise using heatmaps and wordcloud.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of comcast customer complaints dataset. The dataset is pre-processed and cleaned to remove any unnecessary information such as URLs, email addresses, and phone numbers.

## Methodology
The NLP analysis is done using the following steps:

Data loading and EDA analysis using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries to visualize data patterns and trends.
Text preprocessing using spaCy and nltk libraries to remove stop words, punctuation, and perform lemmatization and stemming.
Keyword identification using wordcloud visualization to identify the most common words associated with negative customer feedback.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are used in this project:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SpaCy
- NLTK
- Wordcloud

## Conclusion
`This project demonstrates the use of NLP techniques for analyzing customer reviews in the telecom industry. By identifying the most common words associated with negative feedback, telecom companies can address customer issues and improve their services accordingly. The EDA analysis provides insights into data patterns and trends, which can be used for further analysis and decision-making.`
